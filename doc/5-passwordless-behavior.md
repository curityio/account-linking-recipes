# Passwordless Behavior

This page shows how passwordless logins can be introduced from day one.\
This is done by identifying the user, then setting the primary authentication factor dynamically.

## Example Scenario

There are many security solutions that could be designed with Webauthn.\
In this scenario, internet users can either log in with a password, or can bring their own Webauthn platform device.\
Once the Webauthn device is registered they no longer use password based logins.
Users don't need to be registered with a password in order to set up Webauthn. They can create accounts registering only \
the Webauthn device, without the need of setting up a password.
