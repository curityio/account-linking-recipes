# Migrating to Passkeys Behavior

This page describes shows how logins with passkeys can be introduced in an opt-in manner.\
This enables existing users to upgrade from passwords to passkeys, with the same user identity.

## Requirements

The following flow chart describes the desired behaviour of this flow.

![Use case 4](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/flow.png)

## Example Scenario

There are many security solutions that could be designed with passkeys.\
In this scenario, internet users can either login with a password, or can upgrade to a passkey.\
The scenario handles a number of different user types:

| User Type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Existing Users (Passwords) | Users who continue to sign in with passwords after passkeys are enabled |
| Existing Users (Passkeys) | Users who upgrade from passwords to passkeys when they are are enabled |
| New Users (Passwords) | Future users who sign up and choose to use password logins |
| New Users (Passkeys) | Future users who sign up and choose to use passkey logins |

### Authentication Selection

On every login a username authenticator is shown and the user provides their email.\
This is only typed on the initial login and is then autofilled from a cookie:

![Passkeys Username](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/passkeys-username.png)

A script action then runs to determine whether the user exists and has a passkey registered.\
If the user does not have passkeys they can choose how to sign in via a selector action.\
Users who don't want to use passkeys can continue to use passwords:

![Authentication Selector](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/authentication-selector.png)

### Existing Users

When am existing user first chooses to sign in with a passkey, the user performs the passkey registration ceremony:

![Register Passkey](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/register-passkey.jpg)

Before registering a passkey the user must authenticate by verifying their email:

![Verify Email](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/verify-email.png)

Next, the browser uses operating system APIs to create a passkey.\
To register, the user simply clicks continue and then uses their device authentication method, e.g. a fingerprint or PIN.

![System Dialog](../images/4-migrating-to-passkeys-behavior/system-dialog.png)

On all future logins the username authenticator is displayed and the authentication selector screen is bypassed.\
The user again provides their device authentication method, e.g. a fingerprint or PIN, to prove they are present.

### New Users

When a new user onboards, they first enter their email in the username authenticator.\
If the account is not found, the user is presented with the authentication selection screen.\
The user can choose either passkeys or passwords and in both cases must create an account.

### Roaming and Recovery

Passkeys can be synchronized across multiple browsers and devices, though there are some technology limitations.\
The current technology support is explained in the [Passkeys - Design your Solution](https://curity.io/resources/learn/passkeys-design-your-solution/) article.\
You can enable a solution where the user can recover from any roaming or lost passkey scenario:

- Passkey cannot be synchronized to a particular browser or device
- User clears one or more passkeys from their browser
- User gets a new computer or mobile device

To do so, the user simply performs the registration ceremony again.

### Account Data

After running this flow you can query the account data, as described in the [Default Behavior](./1-default-behavior.md) page.\
The PostgreSQL data will contain a single account record for each user:

| account_id | username | phone | attributes |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 65c4928a-4bab-11ed-bd06-0242ac120002 | john.doe@company.com | 0773344 | given_name: John, family_name: Doe |

Passkeys are stored in a `devices` table, and a simplified form of the data is shown below:

| account_id | device_id | type | publicKey |
| ---------- | --------- | ---- | --------- |
| 65c4928a-4bab-11ed-bd06-0242ac120002 | 6f2761a2-6931-413d-8caa-00e4b4f015d3 | webauthn | pQECAyYgASF ... |

### Access Tokens

For all users, access tokens issued to applications will contain the same values for the subject claim as previously.\
So migrating to passkeys will have no impact on your OAuth-secured APIs:

```json
{
  "jti": "adf9f0fc-3d38-402e-af52-187506190886",
  "delegationId": "cd231bba-ffa7-4c0e-ab5c-69b350fab979",
  "exp": 1665744658,
  "nbf": 1665744358,
  "scope": "openid",
  "iss": "https://14ff-2-26-218-28.eu.ngrok.io/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous",
  "sub": "55ace8f2473cc2848c17d460326122db46dda6cff80d6754d10a0ff5ac13b940",
  "aud": "demo-web-client",
  "iat": 1665744358,
  "purpose": "access_token"
}
```
